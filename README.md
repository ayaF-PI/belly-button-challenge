# Belly Button Biodiversity Dashboard

# Project Overview

This project creates an interactive dashboard to explore the Belly Button Biodiversity dataset, which catalogs the microbial species found in human navels. Using data visualization libraries like D3.js and Plotly.js, the dashboard allows users to explore the top 10 microbial species found in individuals, along with demographic information.
